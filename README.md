# OpenCorporaDict
## Introduction
It's a Morphological analyze library based on the OpenCorpora dictionary.
Project contains:
- library that implements morphological parsing based on the [OpenCorpora dictionary](http://opencorpora.org).
The library is simple, it loads all the necessary dictionary data (xml format) into RAM (about 1.5 gigabytes) and it takes about a minute for the initial download.
The library does not solve the problem of ambiguity and the presence of the letters "ะต"/"ั" in words;
- test application that demonstrates the functionality of the library.
## Project build
The Qbs build system was used with the help of QtCreator IDE.
Project build tested under msvc 16.11 and mingv 11.2.0 compilers using qt 6.2.4.
And i think, it can be build under gcc and clang compilers too.
## Launch of MorphologicalDictionarySimpleGui test application
- pass as a start parameter in the console the absolute path to the xml data of the OpenCorpora dictionary;
- wait for 1-2 minutes of loading;
- use.
